# Unity Learning project - IAmHero
## Personal goal
My goal is to learn about the different systems and architecture of Unity.

The focus of the project is towards gameplay and architecture, art and vfx is imported from unity marketplace.

## About the game
This small game is a horde survivor game with minor rpg like element, including levels and abilities. Inspired by vampire survivor and similar titels.

#### Naming convention
* System - Attach dynamic to gameobjects
* Manager - Persistent world gameobjects
* DataObject - Scriptable Objects
* UI - Game Interface related

## Assets
The assets are free and from the market place, all imported via the package manager.

## Notes
* Migrated from Unity Devops Version Control to GitHub, hence the missing history.
* Had to remove a non free package for animations and characters, character animations are missing for now.
* Project started on the 1 Feb 2025
* Limited time spent per day since I have a 0 year old daughter :)
